# vala-jetbrains-plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### What's Changed

- Added main block support (including using methods, fields with var, etc. outside namespace)
- Added support for declaring interfaces in interfaces
- More forgiving on identifier keywords being used when not specifying @ before to match the Vala parser
- Allow use of dynamic in foreach statement
- Allow use of weak in foreach statement
- Allow permitted type declaration modifiers in interface (abstract, extern, and sealed)
- Allow permitted type declaration modifiers in enum (abstract, extern, and sealed)
- Allow one use of a default statement in a switch
- Remove using expression in default statement in a switch
- Added support for unlock statement
- Allow nullability question mark to be used after identifier in object/array creation expressions
- Allow use of void pointer array type
- Allow use of weak and unowned in local variable declarations
- Now only allow permitted type declaration modifiers in errordomain (extern, abstract, partial, sealed)
- Now only allow permitted type declaration modifiers in delegate (abstract, async, class, extern, inline, override,
  sealed, static, and virtual)
- Add better support for parameter direction (in, out, ref) and ownage (own, unowned)
- Adjust what is permissible with yield statements / expression based on the Vala parser (before any expression could be
  used. Now only method calls can be, and now return isn't permitted after yield)
- Update try, catch, finally block to match the Vala parser (need either finally block or catch clause with a try
  statement, and only one finally)
- Add support for identifiers ending with @ used in config files
- Removed unused spell-check support as platform updated
- Added capability to run parsing/lexing tests on sample files and any repo link
