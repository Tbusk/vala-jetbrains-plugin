<!-- Plugin description -->

Vala language support for Jetbrains IDEs.
            
This plugin provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and other features for development with Vala.
            
This currently is in an early stage of development. Most luxuries of JetBrain IDEs are not implemented yet or are limited.

A Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to provide many features, including documentation, code completion, error checking, etc.
That is required to be installed separately. 

The one that is supported can be found [here](https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-language-server).

Largely, it can be installed in a command or two.  It likely is already installed if you are using other IDEs like VSCode or Neovim with the appropriate plugins.

If you want to support this project or encounter any problems, please consider opening issues (features requests, bug fixes, etc.) or pull requests on our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Tbusk/vala-jetbrains-plugin).
